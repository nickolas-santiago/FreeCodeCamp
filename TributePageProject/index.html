            <p id="tribute-info">Link is the main playable character of Nintendo's video game series <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>. He appears in several incarnations over the course of the games,
                and also features in other Nintendo media, including merchandising, comic books, and a cartoon series. He is one of Nintendo's main icons and one of the most
                well-known and popular characters in video game history.</p>
            <p id="tribute-info">Through <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> series, Link is depicted as a child, teenager, or young adult of the Hylian race, originating from the fictional land of
                Hyrule. Link often travels through Hyrule, defeating creatures, evil forces, and the series' primary antagonist, Ganon, while attempting to save Princess Zelda and Hyrule.
                To defeat Ganon, Link usually requires the mystic Master Sword and Light Arrows, or a similar legendary weapon, obtained after many trials and battles. In the course of his
                journey he will typically acquire various other magical objects or items, including musical instruments and weaponry.</p>

                <li><b>2002</b>  Link travels the Great Sea in <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</em> to rescue his sister and defeat the Helmaroc King; his quest intertwining with that of

                    twilight, in which most people are reduced to nothing more than spirits. However, Link is transformed into a wolf upon entering the twilight. While in this form, he is aided by Midna,

                <li><b>2011</b> During his journey in <em>The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword</em>, Link imbues the Goddess Sword with three sacred flames, which result in it being reforged into the Master Sword.</li>
                <li><b>2013</b> In <em>The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds</em>, Link is a blacksmith's apprentice who is forced to rescue the Seven Sages, descendants of the original Sages who sealed the
                    Sacred Realm years ago, after Yuga, a sorcerer who has the ability to 'merge' into walls and turn people into paintings, brings them to another world, the Kingdom of Lorule, in the form of
                    paintings to revive Ganon.</li>
                <li><b>2017</b> <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> is set thousands of years after Ocarina of Time, though it is not specified as to whether it occurs in the 'Adult Link Timeline',
                    'Child Link Timeline', or 'Fallen Hero Timeline'. Link awakens after a century in a stasis pod, and comes to discover that an evil force called the Calamity Ganon has been trapped in Hyrule
                    Castle for as long as he had been in stasis.</li>
